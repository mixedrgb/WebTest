# WebTest

~~A scaffolding for a future WebAPI using Microsoft SQL Server, MVC, and Entity Framework.~~

This may or may not be in MVC format, but will *probably* use MS SQL Server and EF.

This may or may not change repositories, and may or may not contain
the same code. *Basically* that all means "YOLO."

Heavily based on [This code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)
